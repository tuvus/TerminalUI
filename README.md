## Graphical Terminal Emulator

This project is a terminal emulator with a light GUI. 
The project uses java swing to display the window and text.

The terminal emulator does not support every bash command, this is based on what commands java supports.

### Controls
Use commands like a normal terminal. There are also special commands for convenience:
* Ctrl + Q: Quits the terminal
* Ctrl + L: Clears the terminal
* Ctrl + C: Cancels command input
* Escape: Quits the terminal
